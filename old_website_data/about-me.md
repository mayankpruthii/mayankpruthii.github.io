## my introduction

I am a professional Software Engineer. What made me interested in programming was my initial interest of automating tedious repeatitive tasks and workflows. And as I grew and explored in this field, I became passionate about the problems that good software can solve.

Having worked in tech giants like Amazon and Tata Consultancy Services, I have had a chance to work across various tech stacks for both Frontend and Backend development, including but not limited to Javascript frameworks like React and Express, Microservices framework in Java, Python scripts like Selenium Web Scraping and frameworks like Flask. Along with these, I have also had a chance to build amazing skills in Cloud Technologies like AWS and Openstack. I am familiar with SQL and NoSQL databases, and have made some personal projects which included functionalities like caching, inbuilt memory databases like Redis.

For me, software development is not just limited to coding but also the design and architecture decisions made. I find such work really challenging. Engaging in these types of processes stimulates my mind, simultaneously allowing me to acquire knowledge as I progress.

Apart from software engineering, UI designing and playing the acoustic guitar serve as my creative outlets. Additionally, I dedicate my weekends to volunteer for social causes and playing badminton.
